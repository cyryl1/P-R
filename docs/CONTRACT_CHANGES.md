## Applied changes

### Phase 1 — 2026-10-25

1. `POST /api/projects/validate` returns `{valid, errors, parsed?}`. The `parsed` rules file is present when validation succeeds. Added `ApiSchemas.projects.validateResponse`.
2. `GET /api/projects/:owner/:repo` returns `404` with `NO_RULES` when no file exists. The backend route implements this behavior; the shared API error code already includes `NO_RULES`.
